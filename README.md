Correction model-- two-leaf (TL) light use efficiency (LUE) models (CTL-MOD17)
=
The MOD17 product is probably the most widely used GPP product at present, but many studies have indicated significant error patterns in the MOD17 GPP product. However, studies have found that the two-leaf model can effectively address this issue. Therefore, this study investigates the conversion from the big-leaf to the two-leaf model using the theory of the two-leaf model. We are only based on MODIS GPP products and only use LAI and radiation data again to obtain higher accuracy than the two-leaf model, which can solve the problem of GPP underestimation and overestimation of MODIS GPP products in high/low LAI areas.

Results
=
The calibration model effectively improves the estimation accuracy of GPP and solves the accuracy deviation of MODIS GPP.

Figure 1. Spatial distribution of the differences in the annual summed GPP correction for 2010. (a) The graphs show the differences in longitude from the MOD17, CTL-MOD17, and TL-LUE models. (b) Graph for latitude. (c) △GPP means GPP of the CTL-MOD17 model minus the corresponding value of the MOD17 model; △RMSE refers to the RMSE of the estimated results of the CTL-MOD17 model and the EC GPP of the site minus the corresponding value of MOD17, so the negative points with larger values mean better correction results.
